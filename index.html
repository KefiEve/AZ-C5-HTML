        <h1> <i> <u> <ul> Modern World </ul>  </u>  </i>  </h1>
         <!-- <p>This is a paragraph </p> --> 
       <p> We live in a world were anything is at the tip of our fingers. We have touch screen phones, electric cars, drones and hoverboards to name a few. We are so used to the sedentary lifestyle that we see no need to exercise by just taking a walk or go to the gym. Why take a walk if you can just order online and the food will get delivered right on your doorstep. Have we gotten to a point where we have neglected our bodies? Eating whatever we want and not caring about the consequences.

        That is why obesity is ravaging through societies in the modern world. Processed food is addictive and there is nothing healthy about it. Foods like burgers, potatoes chips, pizza, pies, fizzy drinks and energy drinks, the list is long.  The most painful part is seeing children who are obese and already have health issues like diabetes, heart disease and have difficulty breathing.

        <h2> <i> <u> <ul> Modified </ul></u>  </i>  </h2>
        <!-- <p>This is another paragraph </p> -->
        <p> This day and age, a lot of food that is sold in grocery stores or supermarkets have <b> GMO </b>. Every food package has ingredients written on them but we hardly read them, but a lot of them have GMO written of them. <b> GMO </b> basically means Genetically Modified Organism, it means that most of the food that we eat is modified. Not only vegetation but also the meat that we eat. It also means that the DNA of vegetation and animals have been altered, for the vegetation there will be less use of pesticides and they are not prone to the drought. The vegetation grows in and out of their season. Because they are engineered food they are able to be enriched with <b> vitamin C, K, E and D </b> and also other things that the body needs. But the question is, are Genetically Modified foods good for human consumption?

          <!-- <p>This is another paragraph </p> -->
            Countries like Russia have forbidden the sale of <b> GMO </b> foods in their country and any business that is selling them will be persecuted by the law. Because they believe it is not good for human consumption, we also have the most elevated allergies than any other generation. More people are now allergic to gluten that is found in wheat products because most food include gluten. We have organizations that believe that we should not be consuming <b> GMO </b> foods, that is why we have places like fresh foods markets where they sell organic vegetation, free range meat, gluten-free and diary-free foods. 
            The truth and reality is that we are responsible for what we eat in order to live a long disease from or fruitful life. But when we eat anything that is wrong for our bodies it will surely show, we are what we eat after all.
